This directory contains a GMT .grd file that samples the interface at a
0.01 degree sampling interval, as well as a simple script to plot contours
using the .grd file.

This is an electronic supplement for the SRL paper:

Revised Interface Geometry for the Hikurangi Subduction Zone, New Zealand
by C. A. Williams et al., accepted June, 2013.

The contents of the directory are as follows:
bounds_wgs84.txt:	A file defining the valid region boundary in WGS84
			coordinates (used for plotting).
contours.txt:		Contours used for plotting.
mk_contours.sh:		A simple shell script to plot the contours
			taking as input the name of a GMT .grd file
			and the name of the PostScript output file.
grid_exclude_wgs84.grd:	GMT .grd file with interface geometry at
			0.01 degree resolution. Z-coordinates are in km.
